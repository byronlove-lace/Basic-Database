# Basic Data C++

Basic database that lets user enter details about a person's name, age and phone number. It has lookup, load, save and delete functionality. 

## Description

This program uses ncurses for a text-based UI. It uses C++ file handling functions and a combination of classes and vectors to manage the data.

## Progress

Currrently debugging save and delete functions.

## Background

I made this progress in order to familiarize myself with ncurses and to better understand file handling in C++.
